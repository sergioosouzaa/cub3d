## Cub3d

The Cub3d project is a 42 School project that involves creating a basic 3D game engine from scratch, using the C programming language. It is a part of the curriculum of the school's software engineering program.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the project is to develop a basic 3D game engine from scratch using the C programming language. The game engine should be able to render a 3D world, with walls, floors, and ceilings, and allow the player to move through the world. The engine should also include collision detection, texture mapping, and basic lighting effects.

## Requirements

The Cub3d project has a few requirements that must be met to pass the project:

- The game engine must be written in C.
- The engine must be able to render a 3D world, with walls, floors, and ceilings.
- The engine must include collision detection.
- The engine must include texture mapping.
- The engine must include basic lighting effects.
- The game must be playable, with the player able to move through the world and interact with objects.

## Conclusion

The Cub3d project is a challenging but rewarding project that allows students to develop their skills in C programming and 3D game development. It is an excellent opportunity for students to learn how to create a basic game engine from scratch and gain a deeper understanding of how modern game engines work.
